# PromiseAPI

Provides a Promise-like syntax for a JS Promise-like object in Python. It does not currently implement all methods (still a WIP), but the methods already implemented, such as `then`, `catch`, and `_finally`, do not behave exactly as they do in JavaScript. However, they behave similarly enough that similar code would not get too messed up. Examples are in `test.py`.
